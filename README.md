## Abstract 
Electroencephalography signals are recorded as multidimensional datasets. We propose a new framework based on the augmented covariance that stems from an autoregressive model to improve motor imagery classification.
From the autoregressive model can be derived the Yule-Walker equations, which show the emergence of a symmetric positive definite matrix: the augmented covariance matrix. The state-of the art for classifying covariance matrices is based on Riemannian Geometry. A fairly natural idea is therefore to apply this Riemannian Geometry based approach to these augmented covariance matrices.
The methodology for creating the augmented covariance matrix shows a natural connection with the delay embedding theorem proposed by Takens for dynamical systems. Such an embedding method is based on the knowledge of two parameters: the delay and the embedding dimension, respectively related to the lag and the order of the autoregressive model. This approach provides new methods to compute the hyper-parameters in addition to standard grid search.
The augmented covariance matrix performed noticeably better than any state-of-the-art methods. We will test our approach on several datasets and several subjects using the MOABB framework, using both within-session and cross-session evaluation.
The improvement in results is due to the fact that the augmented covariance matrix incorporates not only spatial but also temporal information. As such, it contains information on the nonlinear components of the signal through the embedding procedure, which allows the leveraging of dynamical systems algorithms.
These results extend the concepts and the results of the Riemannian distance based classification algorithm.

## Requirement
To run the following code you need MOABB:
- Nested Cross Validation using GridSearch you can use MOABB 1.0 [2]
- Nested Cross Validation + MDOP use the branch "https://github.com/carraraig/moabb/tree/Takens_NoParallel_1Metric"

All the packages dependencies are listed in the environment.yml file.
